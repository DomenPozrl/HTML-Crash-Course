# HTML-Crash-Course
This project is just the code that was used in the HTML Crash Course that I found on YouTube. 
I am also including a few notes I took during the lesson.
    html stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    not a programming language

    it's a markup language for creating webpages / documents

    building block of the web

    ctrl + u to see what html is being parsed. Used with php for instance, when the code generates the html so you can se exactly what code was parsed

    f12 for developer console

    to generate dummy text just use lorem and then press tab (works in sublime)

    tags can be inline (dont start new line when you use them)
      or block elements (they start a new line)

    camel case is starting with a lowercase and every start of new word is upper case
